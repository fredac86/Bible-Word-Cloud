# Bible-Word-Cloud
Project - World Cloud: Most appearing words on Bible.

For this project, i created a "word cloud" from Bible. I removed punctuation, and have ignored case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function and generate a image with the size varying according to the occurrence of the words.
